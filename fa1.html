	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>If I were to become a pediatrician, my morning routine would first be to prepare for work. This would include wearing my scrubs and putting together stuff I would need to bring to the hospital. I would also put on kid-friendly accessories in order to engage with my patients more. </p>
	      <p>As soon as I arrive at the hospital, I will start with my morning rounds, checking in with patients and spending time talking to them. I would ask them if their condition has worsened or if they were experiencing any abnormalities. After that, I go check if there are scheduled checkups or surgeries. </p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>As a pediatrician, my main duty is to alleviate and address health concerns of infants, children, or adolescents by diagnosing, treating, and monitoring them. I usually do rounds, prescribe medication, diagnose, perform surgeries, and  provide guidance to parents. Furthermore, I work with my colleagues at the hospital, specifically physicians, doctors of different fields, and other medical staff. We help one another in order to provide the utmost care towards our patients and guidance to their parents or loved ones. </p>
	      <p>Additionally, we use stethoscopes, databases, surgical tools, and more, paired with critical thinking, problem-solving, communication skills, and sufficient medical knowledge in handling patients. This job requires a person full of dedication, care, and compassion towards its patients and I think this is what makes it one of the most fulfilling jobs. </p>

	      <p>Here you will see what a day in a life of a pediatrician looks like. You can see how compassionate and dedicated the doctor in the video is in treating her patients with the utmost care. Every job is tiring, but what makes it worth it is the people you help and I think that pretty much sums up the video.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Nine-year-old Hunter recently came to her pediatrician's office for a routine well-child visit with Kim Backman, PA-C, at UPMC CCP – Bellevue Pediatric Associates. During the exam, Kim detected a heart murmur that had never been noted in Hunter's records before. While Hunter’s mom, who is familiar with heart conditions, was initially surprised, she trusted Kim’s judgment and scheduled a follow-up for her daughter with a cardiologist. After extensive testing, including an echocardiogram, it was determined that Hunter had a hole in the wall that separates the chambers of her heart. Remarkably, Hunter had no symptoms — she wasn’t fatigued, her appetite was good, and she continued to enjoy gymnastics, just like any healthy 9-year-old.</p>
	      <p>Hunter underwent successful cardiac surgery to correct the issue, preventing the potential of more serious complications in the future. The cardiologist later told Hunter’s mom that UPMC CCP’s Kim Backman was “an angel sent by God” for catching the problem so early. To express their gratitude, Hunter’s family brought a beautiful card and plant for Kim. They wanted to thank her for her vigilance and care, knowing that her quick action made all the difference. The family allowed us to share their story, hoping to inspire others to never underestimate the importance of routine check-ups. Hunter’s treatment and results may not be representative of all similar cases.</p>
